# Alt:V Native-UI Cloth Menu

This resource contains a cloth menu made with NativeUI.
Currently, this menu supports only BaseGame cloth.

## Features

- change clothes & porps

## Planed features
- reimplement DLC support

## Nice to know
- Textures currently always go up to 26, as 26 is the highest possible texture. A recalculation and reassignment of the maximum ID is possible but destroys the UI when setting and is therefore not done.

## Usage
- The default key is "K" and can be changed in the client.js at the bottom.
