# Alt:V Native-UI Cloth Menu

This resource contains a cloth menu made with NativeUI.
Currently, this menu supports only BaseGame cloth.

## Features

- change clothes & porps

## Planed features
- reimplement DLC support

## Nice to know
- Textures currently always go up to 26, as 26 is the highest possible texture. A recalculation and reassignment of the maximum ID is possible but destroys the UI when setting and is therefore not done.

## Usage
- The default key is "K" and can be changed in the client.js at the bottom.

## Add DLC Clothes
1. First of all you need a AltV resource of your cloth pack
2. Start the clothes pack in a resource
3. Add your DLC name to the `config.js` in the `dlcList` Array like this. 
```js
export const config = {
   dlcList: [
      'baseGame',
      'eup'
   ]
}
```
**IMPORTANT**
- keep `baseGame` in the Array, otherwise you cant switch back to them.
- add the dlc name without the `mp_m_`/`mp_f_` prefix

## Get your DLC name
If you don't know your DLC name you can take a look in your `.meta` files of the clothes pack at `<dlcName>`.

As an example I am using the EUP pack from my [eup-altv](https://github.com/ExXTreMe315/eup-altv) repository.

In my Meta it's `mp_m_eup` and `mp_f_eup` so the `eup` is the name you need to add to the `config.js`

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

	<dlcName>mp_m_eup</dlcName>
